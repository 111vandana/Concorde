# Concorde

This is a framework for downloading and decoding progressive JPEGs easily on iOS and OS X. It uses [libjpeg-turbo][1] as underlying JPEG implementation. We vendor version 1.4.0 of the static library from libjpeg-turbo's [official release][3] for convenience.

## Usage

Simply install it via [CocoaPods][4]:

```
pod 'Concorde'
```
